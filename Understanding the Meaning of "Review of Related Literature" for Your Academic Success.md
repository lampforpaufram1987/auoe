Writing a **review of related literature** might seem like a daunting task, but with the right approach, it can be much more manageable. Here are the steps you should follow:

### 1. Start with a Clear Research Question

Before you begin writing your review, itâ€™s crucial to have a clear understanding of your research question. This will help you to focus on relevant studies and determine which literature is directly related to your topic.

### 2. Search for Relevant Literature

Use academic databases, such as [Google Scholar](https://tinyurl.com/topessay?keyword=review+of+related+literature+meaning), JSTOR, or ResearchGate, to search for studies, books, and articles related to your topic. You want to gather as much relevant information as possible.

### 3. Organize Your Literature

As you gather sources, itâ€™s important to organize them into themes or categories. This will help you structure your literature review and make it easier to discuss related studies together.
